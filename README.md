[fieldset=Appearance]Bronn is average height for a dwarf and no broader than is typical, though his powerful forearms speak of years spent working working with hammer and pick.  There is a hawkish set  to his feature that can be unsettling, particularly when he stares.  His dark eyes hold an almost electric quality, glittering with the intensity that comes from razor sharp focus and cunning insight, though his gaze is most often fixed upon his work.  His hair and beard are an unremarkable brown, worn mid-length and unadorned.

He generally wears a dark leather tunic over a plain linen shirt, black pants of densely woven wool tucked into his boots.  At his belt he wears a large blade, short hafted axe that is well crafted and immaculately cared for.  About his chest is a bandoleer of light hammers.[/fieldset]
[fieldset=Personality]Bronn tends to keep to himself, listening more than he talks and watching what goes on around him with a keen eye.  His dislikes idle hands, preferring to spend even his off time engaged in some sort of craft.  He normally has some sort of miniature carving or scrimshaw on hand to pass the time if things are particularly slow.  He enjoys ale as much as the next though he is seldom drunk and when he is it's an introspective drunk rather than a boisterous one.  

He does not speak much of his past, though from what he has said it's clear he hates Iverina with a passion that is rivaled only by his dedication to his craft.  He enjoys the company of those he can trust - particularly if they are comfortable enough to not feel the need to fill any silence with meaningless chatter.  Putting on airs of any sort irritates him, as does anything that smacks of elitism.  He believes that things ought to be made elegantly and that a true master of any craft is an artist at heart.[/fieldset]
